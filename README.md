# UEA Computer Vision - Labelling Tool

A Python based polygonal labelling tool for creating segmentation datasets.


Operates as a browser-based application, either as a widget within [IPython Notebook](http://ipython.org).

An example notebook is provided that creates a labelling tool widget and displays it within the notebook (requires that IPython >= 3.0 is installed).

An example Flask-based web app is provided that displays the labelling tool within a web page. To start it, run `python flask_app.py` and open
